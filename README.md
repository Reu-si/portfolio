# portfolio

This portfolio is devided into the languages each program is written in.

# C

These projects are part of the 42 Core Curriculum:

c_lib_ft contains many C functions that I have rewritten.

c_printf is my own implementation of the printf function.

c_get_next_line is a function that reads the next line of a given file.
c_get_next_line_bonus does this for multiple file descriptors.

c_pipe_execution is a program that simulates the pipe operators in shell.

c_swap_algorithm is a program that takes two stacks, a and b (empty), and sorts them in an ascending order into stack a.

c_2D_minigame is a program that takes a map, and gives you a window with a playable 2D game. You have to collect strawberries with a capibara and find the exit after collecting all.

c_minishell is a big project which consists of a program simulating a shell. In a team of two we implemented a lot of functionalities of a real shell, e.g. builtins (such as env, export, echo, pwd, cd...) signals, piping, redirections and heredocs.

c_philo_simulation is a program that simulates the classic "Dining Philosophers Problem." This problem is a well-known synchronization issue in computer science that illustrates challenges with multiple threads or processes accessing shared resourcestakes a number of philosophers. The program takes a time the philosophers need to eat and sleep and how long after they did not eat they will die. Through this task I learned concurrent programming with threads and mutexes.

Comining soon:

A 3D game in C!!!

# C++

I just started learning C++ @42berlin and I have written programs such as a phonebook. And learned about classes, methods, and references.

# Python

Magic_Mirror
    In a team of two we implemented a Magic Mirror Application on a Raspberry Pie.
    The Application displayed a window with information:
    * current time and date
    * current weather information
    * news headlines, changing every couple of seconds
    * departures of the next busses and trains of a specified station
    * a motivational quote per day

In this project I learned about GUI programming and using APIs

# Dart

Beebloom_app
* In a team of 4 we designed and developed an Android app that informs and helps users with the plants they want or own.
